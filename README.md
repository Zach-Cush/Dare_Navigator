 General notice: all of our apps data, that being javascript, routing, databases, even individual compoenents                       
 each have their own design, list of actions, and list of accompanying code and services. it would be                             
 impossible to try and pull all that code out and present it here. I instead took some screen shots of some of
 the different pages and data information I had to work with. I will upload all the pictures here.
 (Ben if you have cany questions or issues and would like to see something more specific in my work you can 
 send me an email at zcush98@gmail.com and I will get back to you with anything for the project u might need.)
